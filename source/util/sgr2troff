#!/bin/sed -f
# A sed filter to replace ANSI SGR escape sequences with near equivalent troff.
# It strips any other unrecognized escape sequences.  You will want your cligen
# config file to specifically use "bold ; -bold" and similar for all SGR specs
# so that a *specific* closing escape is used rather than `plain` = "\e[m".
#
# Example usage (with help2man patched via accompanying `help2manFilter.patch`):
#   help2man -Nf sgr2troff dirq | sed 's/\\ef/\\f/g' > dirq.1
#
# After this, you must hand translate any \fU (underline) & \fV (inverse) font
# switches into something troff-ish (and also to format more nicely - help2man
# is like c2nim - not *quite* good enough to be fully automated).
